# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols (traditionally X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

In coding, creating a Tic Tac Toe game involves designing the game board, implementing the logic for players to take turns placing their symbols on the board, and checking for win conditions after each move. This usually requires data structures to represent the board, functions to handle player input and update the board state, and algorithms to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is a popular project for beginner programmers as it's relatively simple to implement, yet offers opportunities to practice fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions. Additionally, it can be expanded upon with features like an AI opponent or graphical user interface.
